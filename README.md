## 📘 About

This repository documents my self-study of Deep Learning through an online Udemy course: **[The Complete Neural Networks Bootcamp: Theory, Applications](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-neural-networks-bootcamp-theory-applications/)** covering core topics like MLP, CNN, RNN, Transformers, and modern applications such as NLP, CV, and LLMs.
